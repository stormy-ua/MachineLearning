# Machine Learning Playground
Set of machine learning examples and experiments

* [Artificial Neuron](https://github.com/stormy-ua/MachineLearning/blob/master/Artificial%20Neuron/Artificial%20Neuron.ipynb)

  Artifitial neuron implemented from scratch and used for simple classification problem of linear separable data. In addition, the same model implemented for TensorFlow machine learning framework.

* [SVM Classifier](https://github.com/stormy-ua/MachineLearning/blob/master/CIFAR-10/CIFAR-10%20-%20Linear%20Classification.ipynb)

  SVM classifier for multi-class classification problem implementation. All operations are vectorized as much as possible in order to get better performance. The classifier is tested on CIFAR-10 images dataset. Suprisingly, the performance isn't so bad as for this kind of classification problem. The model could be enhanced by adding regularization in order to reduce overfitting to train data.
